  <project_name>Luminous - Next-Gen Integrated Planning & Program Review Platform</project_name>

  <overview>
    Build "Luminous," an AI-enhanced Program Review and Integrated Planning platform for Los Angeles Mission College (LAMC) / LACCD. The application serves as a "System of Engagement" that overlays existing "Systems of Record" (eLumen, PeopleSoft). It prioritizes User Experience (UX) and AI Assistance using Google Gemini to reduce the cognitive load of data analysis and report writing for faculty. The platform transforms compliance-driven Program Review into meaningful institutional improvement by embedding equity analytics, enforcing ACCJC accreditation standards, and creating a "Golden Thread" linking Mission -> Strategic Plan -> Program Goal -> Resource Request.
